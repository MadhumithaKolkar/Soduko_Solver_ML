## About

The Real-Time Sudoku Solver is an application that can capture a Sudoku puzzle from a live video feed or an image, recognize the digits using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and solve the puzzle in real-time. It leverages the power of machine learning and computer vision to automate the process of solving Sudoku puzzles.

## Features

- Captures Sudoku puzzles from live video or images
- Recognizes digits using a CNN trained on handwritten digits dataset
- Solves Sudoku puzzles in real-time
- Provides visual feedback on the solution process

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
>>> git clone [https://github.com/your_username/real-time-sudoku-solver.git](https://github.com/MadhumithaKolkar/Soduko_Solver_ML.git)

2. Run the main script:
python main.py

3. Point the camera towards a Sudoku puzzle or provide an image file containing a Sudoku puzzle.
